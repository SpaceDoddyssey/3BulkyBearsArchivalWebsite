      <p>Hi, I'm Elia Hawley and I worked primarily on the overall localization structure for the game, as well as doing the Italian translations for all the text. 
        On top of this, I built the the movement and physics system for the bears. 
        Finally, I worked on a couple traps and learned how to build tilemaps for testing.</p>

  <p>I managed the level design side, making sure that levels were balanced and fun. I created levels that were unique with my team and would change designs based on player feedback. Also, I helped code the pause menu.</p>
