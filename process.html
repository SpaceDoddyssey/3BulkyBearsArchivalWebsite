              <b>Design Questions Asked</b> <br>
              How does the player choose to move between scenes?
              How does the level selection scene make navigating the game easier? 
              If there are different worlds how will the level selection scene incorporate this into scene selection? 
              How do we show progress with each level in this prototype? <br>
              <br> <b>Knowledge Gained</b> <br>
              We learned how to create a button object that can be used to navigate to other scenes.
              Hierarchy matters when dealing with multiple objects in Unity. 
              We learned how to use assets and import them into button objects.
              Planning to have the bear move to the level the player is on.

                <b>Design Questions Asked</b> <br>
                What sequence of screens will the player progress through to reach the first moment of core gameplay?
                Which special animations or transitions can be used to add a high level of design polish to these first few seconds?
                <br>
                We wanted to create a way to let the user know the game is finished loading in. The animation will play when the game has loaded everything in. 
                After that, it will lead them to a world/level selection, allowing the user to see what they have accomplished and what worlds/levels they can play.
