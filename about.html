      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Through the Computer Science Game Design BS program at UCSC, students are required to work on a capstone game. Students work for multiple quarters to form teams and make games that satisfy constraints you see below.</p>
      <div class="container">

  <div class="constraints">
    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <p> The first constraint was to make an accessible game: able to play the game with 1 hand, playable without sound, must come to a natural resting point around every 2 minutes, completable even when simulating vision limitations: contrast and color sensitivity</p>

  <h2>Localization</h2>
  <p>The second constraint for our game was that all visible text should be localized to 2+ written languages (one logographic, one right to left)</p>
  <p> This constraint was satisfied by including Italian and Chinese as available languages.</p>

<div class="constraints">
  <h2>Game Format</h2>
  <p>The third constraint for our game was that it must be an offline digital game or an online mobile game (able to play on cellular network).</p>

</div>
<div class="constraints">
  <h2>Vertical Slice</h2>
  <p>The last constraint was our game had to be a vertical slice. Meaning it can be scaled up to a full game (at least ideally) using only a lot more authoring effort. That is, a production team should be able to fill out the rest of the content to build the full game using only digital content creation tools like image/sound editors, model editors, level editors, and scripting languages.</p>
